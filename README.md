# fedora_hyprland_scripts
scripts for fedora workstation 42 (supports gnome and hyprland(JKOOLlit dot files))


# Note: still under constructing, might close this project and start with supporting Arch JaKooLit dotfiles 
# Bigger note: this project is not a fork of the Arch-Hyprland-JaKooLit nor fedora's...    this project(if I got an idea) will be a seperate module which can run in normal hyprland
# or Ja's hyprland. This Project is MIT license(too lazy to set up the license) and again THIS IS NOT A FORK PROJECT
